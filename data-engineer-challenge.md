# Challenge: Modeling a Graph Network

## Introduction
We recognize that your time is valuable, and we appreciate you investing that time with us. With that in mind, we've designed this exercise to be done in your spare time and it is untimed. Work on the project when you can and return it to us when you are finished.

You don't need to create a massive, complex piece of software to fulfill this challenge. We're really just looking to see how you think about - and design solutions to - data problems. 

Email any questions to joshua.gooden@dcode.co

Package your completed code as a tarball, zip, or a gitbundle and email it to joshua.gooden@dcode.co and kevin.lewis@dcode.co.

## Objective
To design and implement a graph network using an object-oriented programming language of your choice (e.g. Java, Python, C++, etc.).

## Problem Statement:

A graph network is a collection of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges that connect these vertices. Each vertex represents an entity (e.g. a person, place, or thing) and each edge represents a relationship between two entities. In this challenge, you are to design and implement a graph network that supports the following operations:

- Add a vertex to the graph network
- Add an edge between two vertices in the graph network
- Remove a vertex from the graph network
- Remove an edge from the graph network
- Find the shortest path between two vertices in the graph network (using breadth-first search)


Your implementation should also support the following constraints:
- Each vertex in the graph network can have a maximum of 100 edges
- Each vertex can hold a data payload of up to 100 bytes
- Each edge can hold a weight of up to 1000

### Input:
The input to your implementation will be a list of operations (add vertex, add edge, remove vertex, remove edge, or find shortest path) and the relevant information for each operation (e.g. the vertices, edges, and weights involved).

### Output:
The output of your implementation should be the result of each operation (e.g. success/failure, shortest path, etc.).

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness of the implementation
- Code quality (e.g. readability, maintainability, etc.)
- Time and space complexity of the implementation

### Notes:

- You are allowed to use any libraries or frameworks for testing purposes only (e.g. JUnit for Java, unittest for Python, etc.).
- Your code should be well-documented and include inline comments where necessary.
- You should provide a detailed explanation of your design choices and trade-offs in a separate text file.
Good luck!
