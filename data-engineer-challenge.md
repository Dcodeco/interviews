# Challenge: Modeling a Graph Network

## Objective: To design and implement a graph network using an object-oriented programming language of your choice (e.g. Java, Python, C++, etc.).

## Problem Statement:

A graph network is a collection of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges that connect these vertices. Each vertex represents an entity (e.g. a person, place, or thing) and each edge represents a relationship between two entities. In this challenge, you are to design and implement a graph network that supports the following operations:

- Add a vertex to the graph network
- Add an edge between two vertices in the graph network
- Remove a vertex from the graph network
- Remove an edge from the graph network
- Find the shortest path between two vertices in the graph network (using breadth-first search)


Your implementation should also support the following constraints:
- Each vertex in the graph network can have a maximum of 100 edges
- Each vertex can hold a data payload of up to 100 bytes
- Each edge can hold a weight of up to 1000

### Input:
The input to your implementation will be a list of operations (add vertex, add edge, remove vertex, remove edge, or find shortest path) and the relevant information for each operation (e.g. the vertices, edges, and weights involved).

### Output:
The output of your implementation should be the result of each operation (e.g. success/failure, shortest path, etc.).

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness of the implementation
- Code quality (e.g. readability, maintainability, etc.)
- Time and space complexity of the implementation

### Notes:

- You are allowed to use any libraries or frameworks for testing purposes only (e.g. JUnit for Java, unittest for Python, etc.).
- Your code should be well-documented and include inline comments where necessary.
- You should provide a detailed explanation of your design choices and trade-offs in a separate text file.
Good luck!
